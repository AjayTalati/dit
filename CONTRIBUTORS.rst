Introduction
============

This file contains an incomplete list of people who have contributed to ``dit``.
It is an *inclusive* list, and anyone who has contributed who wishes to make
that contribution known is welcome to add an entry into this file.  As a rule,
no name should be added to this list without the approval of the person
associated with the name.

In general, creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult,
and the list within this file is almost certainly incomplete.  Contributors
include testers, bug reporters, build/integration systems such as
`TravisCI <https://travis-ci.org>`_ and `coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`_,
contributors who wish to remain anonymous, funding sources, advisors, users,
etc.  Simply stated: ``dit`` is a collaborative project.

Do you want to make your contribution known? If you have commit access, edit
this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to
open a `ticket <https://github.com/dit/dit/issues/new>`_ or get in contact with
one of official team `members <https://github.com/dit?tab=members>`_.

A supplementary (but still incomplete) list of contributors is given by the
list of names that have commits in ``dit``'s `git <http://git-scm.com>`_
repository.  This can be obtained via::

	git log --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq
